here I stand: ifelse.main
random.random is an open door!

do you wanna build an IfElseSample?
  or ride a main around the halls (args)?
    if (random() < 0.5) anna
      she's a bit of a fixer-upper
        print 'anna'
    elsa
      she's a bit of a fixer-upper
        print 'elsa'

the cold never bothered me anyway
